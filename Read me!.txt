Hello:)

it's Yassine with you, I'll explain you how the program works
so first of all there are the 3 folders

'css'which contains the css file.

'js' which contains the javascript file.

'guide' which contains screenshots showing how the app works.

Step 1: Click in the file "index.html" which is in the birthday folder to launch the page.

Step 2: click in each message that appears until the end the background changes and an audio launches.

you can simply follow the steps that are in the guide folder.

Thank you :)
